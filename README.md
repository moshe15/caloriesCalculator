As part of the course curriculum - "Android Mobile", which we studied in the third year of our studies at (B.Sc.) in Computer Science, Holon Institute of Technology (H.I.T). We are proud to present our "caloriesCalculator" java & javascript  application 
The application was written on android studio & webstorm 

With our app you can be in control on the amount of calories you eating during the day. In our experience, it helps to maintain a healthy lifestyle and helps those who want to lose weight.

we hope you will enjoy from our app and get the best of it.
