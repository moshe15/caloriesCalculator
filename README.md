As part of the course curriculum - "Android Mobile", which we studied in the third year of our studies at (B.Sc.) in Computer Science, Holon Institute of Technology (H.I.T). We are proud to present our "caloriesCalculator" java & javascript  application 
The application was written on android studio & webstorm
